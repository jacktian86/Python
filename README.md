Python
======
These files are designed to showcase the Python projects I have been working on recently at work.
For confidentiality purposes, the data has been removed and I commented out all the code to preserve compilability.

All files are used to analyze and gather business intelligence that informs strategic decisions. 

Brief Descriptions of each file:

Audit Test -  designed to test the efficacy of our algorithms for identifying at-risk companies. 
Coding highlight: Decorators

O-SCORE script - Calculates the O-score(a metric of financial health) of companies based on their financial statements.
Analyzes potential correlations between O-score and live metrics to create a proprietary algorithm. Allows us to have 
a "live" view of the financial health of companies we monitor. 
Coding highlight: List comprehension, plotting, stats models

Underwritten balance: - analyzes the credit utilization of companies based on their tier.
